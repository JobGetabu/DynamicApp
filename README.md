Dynamic is a simple app that helps Dynamic Savings Group members to keep track Savings and help them request loans with ease.

The app uses the **MVVM Architecture**. I have used the following components for development:

* Room - For offline data persistence
* LiveData - Handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion 
* ViewModel - Manage your UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
* DataBinding -  minimize the glue code necessary to bind your application logic and layouts.
